        Bug 332989 - Allow parts of a package to upgraded or removed
        https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=332989

        The CPP package includes several features/IUs by the p2.inf file in
        the CPP feature; this hasn't been touched and could be part of another
        change.
